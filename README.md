This project is created in relation to a Unerversity course called Programming Interactive 3D Worlds.
The asignment were to create our favorite game but worse, so i created the combat system from Lost In Random.

The idea of the project is to create the combat system from Lost In Random as VR. I chose VR to challenge myself and be on unfamiliar grounds.
The player will be equipped with a slingshot with unlimited ammunition and a M1 Garand and a Thompson M1A1 with no ammunition in an inventory around their waste.
Enemies will then spawn at random intervals at three spawn locations.
The enemies will have two crystals at a time spawning on them, these crystal can be shot with either the weapons or the slingshot, and then spawn two new at a random location when both are destroyed.
Shooting the crystals give energy to the players dice, which can be called with a press on the controller.
When rolled the rolled number converts to points and can be used to purchase 10 shots for the M1 Garand for two points and 20 shots for the Thompson for 4 points.
Then with the ammunition the enemies can be shot and killed.
